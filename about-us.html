				<h3>About This Event</h3>
				<p>Every year, each of the four areas in the Toronto District School Board hosts an area initiative event to bring social change and fun to their district. This year in Area D, an organizing committee has been set up by the Toronto District School Board SuperCouncil to host an event that could create discussions around the serious topic of mental health and awarness.</p>
				<br/>
				<h3>About SuperCouncil</h3>
				<p>SuperCouncil is a democratically elected student body in the TDSB that allows the student voice to be heard in the TDSB boardroom. They host many events such as “Student Leadership Day”, for student leaders from all over the board to meet and bond with each other.</p>
				<br/>
				<h3>About the Organizing Committee</h3>
				<p>The organizing committee for this event is made up of students ranging from grades eight to twelve, with various talents and positive attributes. Executives for the organizing committee were chosen by members of the TDSB SuperCouncil. Ambassadors were hand picked by a recruitment team with members of the executive team. You can view members of the organizing committee <a href="who-we-are.html">on this page</a>.</p>
